# News-Aggregator

In this project I extracted news about differnt topics such as India, Sports, Business from 'Times Of India' newspaper, which is widely read by Indian people. Webpage link for the same - https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ and made topic classification and sentiment analysis of this news. For topic classification I trained classifier to predict topic of differnt news. For sentiment analysis I just used already pre-trained model to classify news on positive and negative and neutral ones. 

Complete Data science Lifecycle is followed for this project
